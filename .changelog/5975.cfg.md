go/runtime/config: Support selection of TEE kind

The node operator can now specify the kind of Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE) in which the runtime component should run. If no TEE is specified,
it is automatically selected, with TDX and SGX taking precedence over ELF.

The following configuration option has been deprecated:

- `runtime.environment`

The following configuration options have been added:

- `runtime.debug_mock_tee` to enable TEE mocking for testing,

- `runtime.runtimes.components.tee` to specify the TEE for a component.

These changes affect the configuration of the client node if the runtime
bundle contains both TEE and non-TEE binaries. In such cases, the node
operator must explicitly configure the runtime to avoid running in a TEE
environment.

Configuring non-TEE Paratime Client Node:

```
mode: client
# ... sections not relevant are omitted ...
runtime:
  paths:
    - {{ runtime_orc_path }}
  runtimes:
  - id: {{ runtime_id }}
    components:
    - id: ronl
      tee: none # Don't run in SGX or TDX!
```

Configuring TEE Paratime Client Node:

```
mode: client
# ... sections not relevant are omitted ...
runtime:
  paths:
    - {{ runtime_orc_path }}
  sgx_loader: /node/bin/oasis-core-runtime-loader
  # environment: sgx # Deprecated, can be removed.
```
