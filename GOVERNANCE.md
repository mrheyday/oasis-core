# Governance Model

*This document is inspired by the [Meritocratic Governance Model] composed by
OSS Watch. It should not be considered set in stone and may evolve over time as
the project grows.*

## Overview

This is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone with an
interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design
and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that
participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the project
community.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the
project. Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment
to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process.

In addition to their actions as users, contributors may also find themselves
doing one or more of the following:

* supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to support new
  users)
* reporting bugs
* identifying requirements
* providing graphics and web design
* programming
* assisting with project infrastructure
* writing documentation
* fixing bugs
* adding features

Contributors engage with the project through the issue tracker, writing or
editing documentation, and participating at our [Oasis Network Community server
on Discord]. They submit changes to the project itself via pull requests, which
will be considered for inclusion in the project by existing committers (see
next section).

### Committers

Committers are community members who have shown that they are committed to the
continued development of the project through ongoing engagement with the
community. The key difference between a committer and a contributor is when this
approval is sought from the community. A committer seeks approval after the
contribution is made, rather than before.

Anyone can become a committer; there are no special requirements, other than to
have shown a willingness and ability to participate in the project as a team
player. Typically, a potential committer will need to show that they have an
understanding of the project, its objectives and its strategy. They will also
have provided valuable contributions to the project over a period of time.

## Contribution Process

Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are
many ways to contribute. The [Oasis Network Community server on Discord] is the
best place to ask questions, and the [Oasis Protocol GitHub] is the best place
to see open bugs, open proposals and more.

For details on how to contribute, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Decision Making Process

Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all
members of the community, from the newest user to the most experienced. All
non-sensitive project management discussion takes place in the Oasis Protocol
GitHub via issues and [Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)].

In order to ensure that the project is not bogged down by endless discussion and
continual voting, the project operates a policy of lazy consensus. This allows
the majority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote.

### ADRs and Lazy Consensus

Decision making typically involves the following steps:

* proposal,
* discussion,
* vote (if consensus is not reached through discussion), and
* decision.

Any community member can make a proposal for consideration by the community and
can do so by creating an issue or pull request proposing an ADR. Discussion of
the proposal can then take place using issue or pull request comments.

In general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it is
recognised as having the support of the community.

For lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least 72 hours
before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement
ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest and respond to the
proposal.

In case consensus is not reached through discussion, the project committers may
vote to either accept the proposal or reject it. Votes are cast using comments
in the proposal pull request. The proposal is accepted by a simple majority
vote.
